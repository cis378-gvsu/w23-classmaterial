## Decision Tree 

Suppose you have the following data:

| temperature | weather | played golf |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| 78 | sunny | yes |
| 30 | sunny | no |
| 93 | sunny | no |
| 72 | cloudy | no |
| 87 | cloudy | yes |
| 81 | cloudy | yes |
| 40 | sunny | yes |
| 90 | cloudy | yes |
| 92 | cloudy | no |
| 28 | sunny | no |
| 35 | cloudy | no |
| 88 | sunny | no |


1. Considering all possible features and all possible splits.
   How many possible choices would need to be consider to determine
   the best choice for the first split (e.g. to choose both the feature and what to split on)?

<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<br><br>



2. Compute the information gain for splitting on weather.


<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br>


2. Choose 5 points at random.  Compute the information gain for each possible threshold if
   splitting on temperature based on those 5 chosen data points.

<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br>

3. Based on parts 1 and 2, what feature should you split on first and what should the threshold
   be if applicable?
