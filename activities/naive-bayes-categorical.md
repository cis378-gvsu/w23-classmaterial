## Naive Bayes

### Extracting probabilities (categorical data)

Suppose you have the following data:

| temperature | weather | played golf |
| warm | sunny | yes |
| cold | rainy | no |
| hot | sunny | no |
| warm | rainy | no |
| hot | rainy | yes |
| warm | cloudy | yes |
| cold | sunny | yes |
| hot | cloudy | yes |
| hot | cloudy | no |
| cold | sunny | no |
| cold | cloudy | no |
| hot | rainy | no |

1. Estiimate the probability of each class given the data:









2. Estimate the conditional probabilities for each attribute:

























### Applying Naive Bayes
Given a new day that is hot and cloudy, predict whether the person will golf using Naive Bayes
