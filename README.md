# Welcome to CIS 378 - Applied Machine Learning, Winter 2023

## About the Course

### Course Overview
This course should help acquaint you with:

* different machine learning algorithms including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning
* how to choose between and apply machine learning algorithms to a variety of problems
* how to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms
* the concerns of machine learning algorithms and their applications

### Need Help?
If you have questions, please ask!  I'm here to help.  I welcome students
to drop by office hours, either virtual or in-person,
to work on their projects and listen to questions others might have (or chat
about other CS topics, grad school, etc.)
