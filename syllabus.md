## Piazza
We will be using Piazza for **all class related communication**.
Please read the [Piazza FAQ](piazza-faq.md) for more details.  
In particular, note that important announcements will be posted
to Piazza and you are responsible for monitoring it and
that **all questions and concerns**
should be posted to Piazza (instead of emailed).  Emails
will likely be redirected to be posted to Piazza and then
answered there.  Piazza is available
both web-based and as a phone app.

## Extra Credit
There will be one opportunities for extra credit.  

* Extra credit will be awarded for good questions (as marked by the
  instructor) and good answers (as endorsed by the instructor) on Piazza.
  The exact formula is not yet determined, but the extra credit will
  be capped at 1% of the overall course grade.

## Course Policies
This course is subject to the GVSU policies listed at
[http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/](http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/).

### General Course Policies
* All assignments should be well formatted jupyter notebooks (aka, markdown
  cells used to answer questions, explain your approach, etc).  Do not simply
  turn in code with no formatted explanations
* You have 8 late days that you can spread between the different assignments with no penalty.
  When you are submitting something late, please post a private Piazza note so I know.
  Due to time constraints with grading at the end of the semester, late days may not be able
  to be used on the final assignment.  No late final projects are accepted.
* If health issues for you or someone you care for,
  childcare issues, etc. arise, please post
  a private Piazza note to the me ASAP so we can work together to
  identify a solution.
* There may be a need for changes to happen midsemester, so this
  information is tentative and the
  instructor reserves the right to modify course policies, the course
  calendar, due dates, number of assignments, office hour times and modality,
  etc.

### Assignment Policies
Programming assignments should be completed in Python unless otherwise stated and should
be turned in as a jupyter notebook.  Tentatively these jupyter notebooks will
be on Google Colab, likely committed to a github repo (but this will be flexible
based on how well Google Colab appears to be working)

### Final Project Policies
As part of this course, you will complete a final project.  This final
project is open-ended and allows you to apply the topics covered in this
course to a different application or explore a ML topic not covered in this
course.  The project will be due prior to the scheduled final exam time,
and informal presentations will occur during the scheduled final exam time.

### Quiz Policies
There will be one or more short quizzes in class announced in advance.
More details will follow prior to the first quiz.

### Academic Honesty Policies
All students are expected to adhere to the academic honesty standards
set forth by Grand Valley State University. In addition, students
in this course are expected to adhere to the [academic honesty
guidelines as set forth by the School of Computing and Information
Systems](https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/academic-honesty-30.htm). Fundamentally,
the work you submit must be your own.  When in doubt, ask the instructor
first and cite any resources.

For this course:
* **Assignments**:  can be completed either individually or in groups of at
  most 2.  You can discuss general ideas with other groups, but fundamentally
  what you or your group turns in must be the work of its own members.
  You are not allowed to copy code from online (even if you change
  parts of the code).  You are also not allowed to use or benefit from any full
  solutions to problems (or solutions to a large component of a problem) 
  that you may find online.
* **Project**:  should be completed individually.  This means that
  each student will turn in their own final project, and that
  solution must be their own work.  You are not allowed to copy code from online (even if you change
  parts of the code).  You are also not allowed to use or benefit from any full
  solutions available online.  Fundamentally, the work you turn in must be your own.
* **Quizzes**:  Quizzes are to be completed individually.

#### FAQs:
* Can I use ChatGPT, Google Co-pilot, or similar technologies? *No, the work you
  submit must be your own and all code should be written by you, so this would
  be considered an academic integrity violation*
* Can I seek help through sites like upwork? *No, this would generally be
  considered an academic integrity violation*
* Can I have help from a tutor?  *You may seek help from a tutor, but the work
  you submit for projects in the end must be your own.  You may not consult
  tutors when taking exams.*
* Can I use sites like stackoverflow?  *Yes, this is allowed in this course,
  so long as you are not simply posting your entire problem and asking
  for a solution and that you do not look for or use a full solution to a large
  portion of the problem (regardless of whether or not you were the one asking).*
* Can I use sites like Chegg?  *No, this would be considered an academic
  integrity violation, even if you were not the one posting the question*
* Can I use general online resources?  *That depends.
  Fundamentally, the work you turn in must
  be your own.  This means that heavily basing your solution on (or directly copying)
  code for a significant component of a problem is not allowed.  Talk to me first.*

#### Regret Policy
I recognize that courses can be stressful and occasional lapses of judgement
occur where students commit an academic integrity violation and regret it shortly
after.  In order to create an environment where you can take responsibility for
your actions, this course will have a "regret policy".  Within 48 hours of
the due date of an assignment, the time of a quiz, or within 24 hours of completion
of the final project, you can
withdraw your submission if after contemplation you believe you may have committed
academic misconduct.  To do so, you must inform me in via email or private Piazza
note within 48 hours of the due date / late deadline including the following text:
> I wish to invoke the regret clause for [ASSESSMENT NAME].

Upon invoking the regret clause
1. You will need to meet with me so we can talk through what happened.  Maybe
   there are bigger issues outside of class that need to be dealt with, maybe
   this wouldn't have actually been an academic integrity violation.
   The point of this meeting is not to
   be scary or a punishment, it's to talk through what happened.
2. You will be withdrawing your submission and as such will
   receive a 0 on the entire assessment.
3. Because you made this decision of your own accord and withdrew your submission,
   this instance will not be considered an academic integrity violation and will
   not be reported to OSCCR (except when there is a clear pattern of repeated
   invocations of this clause).

I will not look at any submissions until 48 hours after the due date / late
deadline / exam completion time.
If the 48 hours have passed and you have not informed me of
your desire to invoke the "regret clause" and I detect academic misconduct, it
will result in disciplinary action, up to failure in the course, and will be
reported to the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution.

## Equity and Inclusion
As an instructor, I strive to create an equitable and inclusive learning
environment in our class.  Please reach out to me if there is any behavior in
the classroom that makes you feel unwelcome in any way.  To the extent permitted
by law, I will keep this information confidential.

## Special Assistance
If there is any student in this class who has special
needs because of learning, physical or other disability,
please contact me and Disability Support Resources (DSR)
